                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    As AI agents gain autonomy and influence in real-world contexts, verifying their technical performance alone is insufficient. It is essential to guarantee their adherence to ethical, legal, and organizational standards. Governance within an MCP-driven system establishes the rules, policies, and supervision that foster accountable agent behavior. This structure underpins trust and supports regulatory compliance in intricate, multi-agent settings.

            <!-- Policy Enforcement Section -->
            <section id="policy-enforcement" class="mb-16">
                 <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8 text-center">Policy Enforcement at the Protocol Level</h2>
                 <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">The MCP server acts as the central hub for applying 'policy as code.' Rather than trusting each agent, you set rules directly at the resource and tool layer. This centralized approach improves enforcement and makes auditing simpler.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Establish rules specifying which agents or agent groups are authorized to access particular tools. For instance, only a 'FinancialAgent' may use the `execute_trade` tool.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limits & Quotas:</strong> Limit tool usage to prevent misuse or excessive activity. For example, restrict agents to 1,000 API calls daily or cap their spending within a set budget.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Access Control:</strong> Control data access by limiting which agents can view sensitive resources, maintaining compliance with standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8 text-center">Audit Trails, Explainability & Accountability</h2>
                <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">When an agent acts, especially in crucial moments, you must be able to answer 'why?' A secure, comprehensive audit trail is essential for both transparency and accountability.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg mt-4">MCP servers are ideally positioned to generate these logs, capturing:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong>Who:</strong> The unique ID of the agent that initiated the action.</li>
                        <li><strong>What:</strong> The particular tool invoked and the precise parameters supplied.</li>
                        <li><strong>When:</strong> A precise timestamp for the event.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The result of the tool execution, whether success or failure.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p class="text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">This thorough logging builds a traceable record, allowing every action to be linked to its source and clarifying the reasoning behind each agent’s decisions.

                        Complete autonomy isn’t always ideal; critical decisions require strong governance with human oversight.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 text-lg text-indigo-800">
                        <li><strong>Approval Workflows:</strong> Set MCP tools to need human approval before performing irreversible actions, such as deploying code to production or transferring funds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Red Teaming:</strong> Continuously probe your agentic system’s limits. Security teams can ‘red team’ agents with prompts crafted to trigger unsafe or non-compliant actions, exposing policy gaps before they’re exploited.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regulatory Constraints:</strong> A robust governance framework is vital for showing regulators your AI complies with legal and ethical requirements.</li>

                 <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                   Governance fuels innovation, not hinders it. Integrating policy enforcement, audit trails, and human oversight within your MCP architecture creates the trust needed to deploy robust, autonomous agents safely and at scale.
