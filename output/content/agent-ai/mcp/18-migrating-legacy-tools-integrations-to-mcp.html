                    Certainly! Here’s a rewritten version of similar length:

Few organizations can begin anew; instead, they rely on years—sometimes decades—of accumulated APIs, internal tools, and vital microservices. Integrating agentic AI may feel out of reach amid such complexity. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers a practical solution, enabling you to encapsulate legacy systems and present them to contemporary AI agents in a secure, standardized fashion.

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">The main concept is to keep your current systems, adding a slim ‘adapter’ layer. This adapter converts MCP’s standard language into the protocols and formats your legacy service uses.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">An MCP tool definition serves as an adapter: it explains the tool’s purpose in natural language for the agent, lists required inputs, and holds the logic to invoke legacy APIs, functions, or microservices. The agent communicates solely with the streamlined MCP interface, never exposed to underlying complexities.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">A phased migration is generally better than a sudden switch, as it supports a seamless transition and keeps business operations running smoothly.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong>Strangler Fig Pattern:</strong> Incrementally phase out the old system by shifting traffic to MCP-enabled endpoints. Begin with a single function, wrap it with an MCP tool, and reroute agentic workflows to utilize it. Continue adding wrappers until direct integrations with the legacy system are fully replaced.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parallel Run:</strong> Operate both the legacy system and the new MCP-wrapped system in parallel for a set time. This lets you compare results and confirm the MCP integration works as intended before switching over. Recommended for high-risk, critical systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Backward Compatibility:</strong> The MCP server can be built to handle multiple tool versions, letting older agents use stable releases while newer agents access updated features, so migration doesn’t leave anyone behind.</li>

                        Transitioning legacy integrations to a unified MCP interface goes beyond technical updates; it drives real business impact.

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-3 text-lg text-indigo-800">
                         <li><strong>Reduced Maintenance Overhead:</strong> Rather than juggling countless custom integrations, you manage one unified protocol, streamlining troubleshooting, upgrades, and security oversight.</li>
                         <li><strong>Unified, Discoverable Interface:</strong> MCP offers a unified entry point to your enterprise tools, enabling developers and AI agents to quickly find and utilize resources, speeding up both development and innovation.</li>
                         <li><strong>Future-Proofing Your Architecture:</strong> Separating your AI agents from backend systems gives you major flexibility—you can replace an old microservice with a new one seamlessly, as long as the MCP tool interface stays the same.</li>
