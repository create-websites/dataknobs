    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Tech -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a non-linear, exploratory journey. Instead of a linear report, it uses a tab-based navigation to allow users to jump to sections that interest them most: 'Introduction', 'Core Principles', 'Is It Right For You?', 'Compare Architectures', 'Tech Stack', and 'Roadmap'. This structure was chosen because the source report serves different user goals (learning, evaluation, implementation planning). An interactive, task-oriented structure is more usable than a static document. For example, the 'Is It Right For You?' section turns passive reading into an active self-assessment, and the 'Compare' section uses a dynamic radar chart for more effective data synthesis than a static table. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: The four principles. -> Goal: Inform/Organize. -> Viz/Method: Interactive cards with revealable details. -> Interaction: Click-to-reveal. -> Justification: Keeps the UI clean and lets users focus on one principle at a time. -> Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: When to use/not use Data Mesh. -> Goal: Inform/Evaluate. -> Viz/Method: Interactive checklist. -> Interaction: User checks boxes representing their organization's state. -> Justification: Turns abstract criteria into a concrete self-evaluation tool, providing immediate, personalized feedback. -> Method: HTML/JS.
        - Report Info: Comparison of architectures (Table 1). -> Goal: Compare. -> Viz/Method: Dynamic Radar Chart. -> Interaction: User selects architectures from dropdowns to see them plotted against each other. -> Justification: A radar chart provides a much faster, more intuitive multi-axial comparison than a table, highlighting strengths and weaknesses visually. -> Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Implementation Roadmap. -> Goal: Organize/Inform. -> Viz/Method: Visual step-by-step timeline. -> Interaction: Click on a step to see details. -> Justification: Visualizes the process sequentially, making it easier to understand the flow and dependencies. -> Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Technology Stack. -> Goal: Organize/Inform. -> Viz/Method: Layered diagram. -> Interaction: Click on a layer to see example tools. -> Justification: Organizes tools conceptually by their role in the platform, clarifying their purpose. -> Method: HTML/CSS/JS. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What is Data Mesh?</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">This section introduces the core problem that Data Mesh solves. Traditional data platforms, like data warehouses and data lakes, often become bottlenecks in large organizations, slowing down innovation. Data Mesh offers a new approach by decentralizing data ownership and treating data as a product. The goal is to move from a centralized, pipeline-focused model to a decentralized ecosystem of discoverable and usable data products.</p>

                            <h3 class="font-bold text-xl text-blue-800 mb-2">Organizational Bottlenecks</h3>
                            <p class="text-blue-700">Central data teams are overwhelmed with requests, creating a massive backlog and frustrating data consumers who need timely insights.</p>

                            <h3 class="font-bold text-xl text-green-800 mb-2">Loss of Context & Quality</h3>
                            <p class="text-green-700">Central teams lack domain knowledge, leading to misinterpretations and low-quality data that erodes trust across the organization.</p>

                            <h3 class="font-bold text-xl text-yellow-800 mb-2">The Accountability Gap</h3>
                            <p class="text-yellow-700">Data producers aren't responsible for analytical use, while central teams are accountable for data they don't truly understand at its source.</p>

It's a **sociotechnical** shift, meaning it changes not just technology, but also team structures, responsibilities, and culture. It applies proven principles from modern distributed software architecture (like microservices) to the world of analytical data.</p>
