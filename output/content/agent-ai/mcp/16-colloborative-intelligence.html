                    A major leap for agentic AI is empowering teams of specialized agents to tackle complex tasks together, rather than simply making each agent smarter. As with human teams, this demands communication, coordination, and a shared goal. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) serves as the core framework, acting as a collaborative workspace that lets agents coordinate seamlessly without direct, intricate peer-to-peer exchanges.

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">An MCP server acts as a central hub—a shared workspace—where agents collaborate. Its resource store serves as a common area for posting updates, sharing discoveries, and assigning or claiming tasks.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">This model enables strong, independent collaboration. Each agent is unaware of which others are active; it simply reads from and writes to the shared context. This stateful approach is what makes advanced teamwork possible, letting agents build on one another’s results.</p>

                        <li><strong>Preventing Duplication of Effort:</strong> Prior to beginning a task (such as investigating a topic), an agent can check the shared context to determine if its status is 'in-progress' or 'completed.' If the task is already claimed, it proceeds to the next open assignment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conflict Resolution via Locking:</strong> For vital resources, an MCP tool may use a 'locking' feature. Agents can 'check out' items, blocking others from changes until the lock is lifted. This preserves data integrity in complex operations.</li>

                        Here's a rewritten version of similar size:

Imagine the task: 'Create a comprehensive overview of the electric vehicle market.' A group of expert agents can work together on this, coordinating through an MCP server.
                    </p>
                    
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-4 text-lg text-indigo-800">
                        <li><strong>The Planner Agent:</strong> Processes the request, organizes it into actionable steps (e.g., identify top competitors, assess market share, compile news updates), and uploads this structured `plan.json` to the MCP server with all items set to 'pending.'</li>
                        <li><strong>The Research Agents:</strong> A team of expert researcher agents oversees the plan. One may focus on finance, another on news trends. Each agent selects a 'pending' task, marks it 'in-progress,' and applies their tools to collect data. They upload their results as distinct files (e.g., `risk_report.md`, `industry_data.csv`).</li>
                        <li><strong>The Writer Agent:</strong> This agent activates once every task in `plan.json` is set to 'completed.' It retrieves all research findings from the MCP server, integrates them into a unified summary, and generates the final report.</li>
                    </ol>

                   MCP introduces core building blocks for evolving isolated AI agents into coordinated, intelligent collectives. Through shared context, these agent teams collaborate to reach objectives unattainable by individuals, enabling a transformative approach to complex, emergent problem-solving.
