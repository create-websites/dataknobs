        Application Structure Plan: A single-page, top-to-bottom scrolling narrative infographic. The flow starts with a high-impact statistic to hook the user, followed by sections that logically break down the report: The Core Problem, The AI Solution, Technology Blueprint, Market Landscape, Risk Mitigation, and Development Roadmap. This linear narrative structure is ideal for an infographic, guiding the user through a complex topic in a clear, step-by-step story.

        Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: Jurisdictional complexity -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Single Big Number -> Justification: Grabs attention with a powerful, easily digestible statistic. Method: HTML/CSS.
        - Report Info: Value Proposition -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Icon-based feature list -> Justification: Quickly communicates the core benefits of the AI assistant. Method: Unicode Icons + HTML/CSS.
        - Report Info: AI Architecture (NLP->LKG->NLG) -> Goal: Organize/Show Process -> Viz: HTML Flowchart -> Justification: A clear, non-SVG way to visualize the data flow and system logic. Method: HTML/CSS with Tailwind.
        - Report Info: Market Landscape Table -> Goal: Compare/Relationships -> Viz: Chart.js Bubble Chart -> Justification: Effectively visualizes three dimensions (market position, tech sophistication, value) for competitor comparison. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Critical Risks -> Goal: Organize -> Viz: HTML Card Grid -> Justification: Presents risks and their mitigations in a clean, parallel structure for easy comparison. Method: HTML/CSS with Tailwind.
        - Report Info: Development Phases -> Goal: Show Change/Organize -> Viz: HTML Timeline -> Justification: A classic DataStory element that clearly shows the sequential plan for development. Method: HTML/CSS with Tailwind.
